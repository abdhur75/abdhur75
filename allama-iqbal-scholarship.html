    <p>As a Sri Lankan student pursuing my BS in Computer Science at PAF-IAST in Pakistan, I owe much of my journey to the Allama Iqbal Scholarship. Named after the visionary poet-philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal, this program by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan opens doors for Sri Lankan youth to access quality education abroad.</p>
    <p>Launched to strengthen bilateral ties, the scholarship covers undergraduate, master's, and PhD programs in fields like engineering, medicine, and sciences. It includes tuition, accommodation, and stipends, easing financial burdens. As a recipient, I've experienced firsthand how it fosters cultural exchange and academic excellence.</p>

    <p>The application process is merit-based, involving aptitude tests and interviews. Eligibility requires strong academic records, with preferences for STEM fields. For 2025, applications open soon via the HEC portal. My tip: Prepare thoroughly, highlighting how your goals align with Pakistan-Sri Lanka relations.</p>
    <p>Beyond academics, the scholarship builds networks. Interacting with Pakistani peers has broadened my perspectives, inspiring projects like AI-driven cultural preservation tools. Challenges like adapting to new climates exist, but support from the Pakistani High Commission in Colombo helps.</p>

    <p>The program's impact is profound. Many alumni return to Sri Lanka as professionals, contributing to development. For aspiring students, it's a gateway to world-class universities and global opportunities. As I near graduation, I'm grateful for this chance â€“ it transformed my dreams into reality.</p>
    <p>If you're a Sri Lankan student eyeing higher education, consider the Allama Iqbal Scholarship. It's not just funding; it's a bridge to a brighter future.</p>
